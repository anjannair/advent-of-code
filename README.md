# Advent of Code (Java)

> Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.


Here you will find the solution arranged day wise. For practical purposes I have removed the input files as you can login to AoC and get your own input files.

Note - Your input files may differ from others. To add your own input files you will need to rename your input files to something like the following - 

`day1input.txt`

The day can be incremented depending on the day you are working on. So for day 2 the file name will be `day2input.txt` and so on.
